# Hi!

--

This 'minimal flipbook' template has a couple of classic examples to get you building your first flipbooks!

--

flipbooks are code-movies.  The frames of the movies are slides. Here we use the R package {xaringan} to create a remark.js slideshow. 

--

Slide breaks are indicated with `---` (be careful trailing white space is not allowed)

--

flipbookr's `chunk_reveal()` disassembles a single code chunk and creates the "build" of multiple partial-code chunks on different slides (the --- is automatically generated for you too).  

--

We use `chunk_reveal()` it 'inline', not in a code chunk. 

--

Let's start!

# First up: classic flipbook, using defaults to walk through code pipeline





<!-- get a flipbook version of the my_cars code chunk - pauses are where parentheses are balanced -->
---

`r flipbookr:::chunk_reveal_live("my_cars")`

```{r my_cars, include = FALSE}
cars |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = speed)
```
